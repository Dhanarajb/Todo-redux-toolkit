#### Set Up Redux Store:
> - Create a new directory named store in your project to hold Redux-related files.
> - Inside the store directory, create a file named store.js (or any other name you prefer).
> - Configure your Redux store using Redux Toolkit's configureStore function. Define reducers, middleware, and any other store configurations.
